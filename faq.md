# Why did [xyz] get banned?

Our channel is regularly targeted by abusive and persistent trolls. Freenode only allows a limited number of channel bans, so our bot has to rotate them. This means many previous trolls are able to join for a few seconds before being re-banned. Please trust that there's a good reason. Moderating this channel is already emotionally exhausting enough without having to rehash everything on demand, especially to newcomers.
