# Rules and Guidelines

### 6. Feminists of All Tendencies Are Welcome Here**.

We ask that sectarianism be kept to a minimum. While criticism is allowed, we do not tolerate trash-talking or petty fighting; it must come from a position of striving to improve feminism and the material conditions of women's lives. People repeatedly 'trash talking' other groups, or trolling with their criticism, can and will be muted or banned.


### 8. Unwelcome Comments on Users' Personal Choices Will Not Be Allowed.
Although we recognize the personal is political, this is not a space to express uninvited opinions or criticize other people's personal lifestyle choices, especially as it concerns health, diet, employment, body modification, and personal relationships.

### Notes

#### *On free speech:

* This chat room is meant to be a more friendly place for feminists to participate without having to be subjected to oppressive speech. Women, people of colour, queer people should feel welcome. Do your part.
* This is not restricted to comments that are openly hateful (for example: I hate women, women are inferior, etc). For example: if there is a comment about the first woman cosmonaut, and there is a user who chose to comment solely on her hair, this poster is being objectively sexist. Try to educate yourselves and each other. The moderators will try not to be overzealous in enforcing the policy, but politely ask that you try to err against posting offensive things. This chat room believes that humour, serious theoretical discussions and casual conversations can all be had without offending anyone.

ix. This chat room's aim towards this subject is to create a class-conscious speech. Readers will note that speech has a class character, and that socialist feminists are against bourgeois speech. The aim of this space is to create an environment that promotes continuous discussion that accretes theory and knowledge.
